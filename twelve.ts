// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

for (let i = 0; i < names1.length; i++){
    console.log(`Assalam O Alaikum ${names1[i]} Have a great day!`);
